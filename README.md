The Landing Page project is an assignment given by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to its students, it is built using only HTML and CSS. It demonstrates the use of the basic concepts of **Flexbox**, as well as the basic concepts of the __Box model__ in order to create a well-structured website.
